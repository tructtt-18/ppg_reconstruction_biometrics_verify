# PPG Reconstruction Biometrics (Reconstruction Error)

This repository accompanies the paper **"Reconstruction Error as a Biometric Signature: Autoencoder and Diffusion Approaches on PPG Signals"**.

It provides **core model architectures + inference helpers** for:
- TCN baseline 
- Conditional GAN 
- Conditional Convolutional Autoencoder 
- Conditional Diffusion model
